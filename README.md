# -Relational-Database-Design-Project-SQl-
📌 Overview
This project focuses on converting a relational database design into a fully implemented SQL Server database. The goal is to define a robust schema with proper keys and relationships, insert and manage data, and ensure referential integrity across all tables.

🧩 Key Tasks
1. 🎨 Defining the Schema
Created tables for:

Users

Roles

UserAccounts

Statuses

Defined Primary Keys for each table to uniquely identify records.

2. 🔗 Creating Relationships
Established Foreign Key constraints to link related tables.

Ensured referential integrity through properly designed relationships.

3. 📝 Data Insertion
Inserted at least two rows into each table for sample population.

4. 🗑️ Data Deletion
Deleted all records as part of data lifecycle and cleanup operations.

⚙️ Technologies Used
